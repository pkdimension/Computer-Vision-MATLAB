This repository contains programs in MATLAB for Object Detection using colour,Line Allignment,Cross Detection,Distance calculation.

1)Object Detection - The program differentiate golden ball from coloured ball.

2)Line Allignment-For a line tracer,centroid of the line returned is used to keep the robot in the centre.

3)Cross Detection-For a line tracer to stop at desired cross,Cross Detection is made using the area of the blob.

4)Distance calculation-Distance from the camera is relatively calculated.This program returns a value which can be used to estimate approximate distance of the object from camera.
