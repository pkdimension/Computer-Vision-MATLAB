This repository contains programs in MATLAB for Object Detection,Line Allignment,Cross Detection,Distance calculation.

1)Object Detection - The program differentiate golden ball from coloured ball.

2)Line Allignment-Centroid of the line returned for allignment.

3)Cross Detection-Cross Detection is made using the area of the blob.

4)Distance calculation-Distance from the camera is relatively calculated.The program returns a value which can be used to estimate approximate distance of the object from camera.
